# CP1404 Practicals

Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

## About me

My name is Darcy Brooks. I am a first year university student studying at JCU.
This repo is a collection of all the work I've done for the subject CP1404.

## What I've learned

These are some things I've learned about clean code.

- Always use the right tool for the job
- Having clean code makes it easier to look back on later and find bugs
- Always following the same best practice format means it becomes second nature
