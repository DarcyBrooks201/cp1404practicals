# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

The estimate was often under the actual time, sometimes by a small amount, other by a fair while.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

My estimates increased in length to try and counteract the fact it took longer than estimated last time, but still often
fell short as the newer pracs were more complicated and took even longer still. So sadly my overall accuracy didn't
improve too much.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

That coding takes a fair amount of time, even if you know what your doing, or have a scafold to copy from. Therefor you
should try and give yourself extra headway when you allocate time to complete a task.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

That most of what I had done was good, but I could still fix some things.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Attention to detail when I'm looking for how similar something is to what I wrote, and to take note of how other people
do the work, so I can improve my own.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 08 feedback](https://github.com/Sebered/cp1404practicals/pull/5#event-15345096682)

### Explanation

The comment about having variables stored inside __init__ rather than as a local variable of a function means that the
file can be improved on later more easily thanks to having easy access to the values

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 06 feedback](https://github.com/thantthuaung/cp1404parcticals/pull/3)

### Explanation

The comment about setting the default cost of guitar to 0.0 instead of just 0, shows that the cost is intended to be a
float rather than an integer. Knowing this when you come back and read through the code later helps a lot.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Having a solution to all of the practical files rather than just some. Being able to check how something is done in
context if you're stuck, or being able to see how close you were to the model example is really helpful. I understand
you don't want people copying, but if they are not learning from the pracs then they would fail the exam (and then the
subject) anyway.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I think I did github commits really well, saving after each milestone, adding an important message in imperative tone,
and pushing all the commits once you're done with the file.
